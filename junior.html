                Dimitrov as junior Wimbledon champion for 2008
                He began the 2008 Grand Slam season with a quarterfinal 
                showing at the French Open, losing to Poland's Jerzy Janowicz in
                 three sets. However he went on to win Wimbledon after defeating Henri
                  Kontinen of Finland in the final. He won the title without dropping a 
                  set despite playing with a shoulder injury throughout the tournament. The 
                  victory saw him join former junior champions Roger Federer and Stefan Edberg 
                  and guaranteed him a wildcard entry into the 2009 Wimbledon men's draw. His 
                  success continued at the US Open, which he won on 7 September, defeating American
                   qualifier Devin Britton in two sets.On his way to the title he also defeated top
                    seed Yang Tsung-hua of Taiwan in the semifinals. After the tournament Dimitrov announced
                     that he was ending his junior career and focusing on improving his ATP ranking. On 8 
                     September 2008, he became junior world No. 1 overtaking Yang Tsung-hua. He closed at No. 
                     3 of the junior ranking that year.Dimitrov compiled a singles win–loss record of 74–28 
                     as a junior (and 42–20 in doubles).
