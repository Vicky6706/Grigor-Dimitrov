            <p>Grigor Dimitrov was born in Haskovo to father Dimitar, 
                a tennis coach, and mother Maria, a sports teacher and former volleyball
                 player, in 1991. He first held a tennis racket, given to him by his mother,
                  at the age of three, and when he was five he began to play daily. In his early years
                   his father served as his coach, but after he proved his talent in the tournaments for juniors, 
                   he made it clear that he would have to develop in other conditions. At the age of 16, Dimitrov turned professional.

                In 2007, Dimitrov joined the academy "Sanchez-Casal", where he was further 
                trained under the leadership of Emilio Sánchez and Pato Álvarez. Since March 2009
                 Dimitrov trained in Paris, France, where he joined Patrick Mouratoglou's tennis 
                 academy and spent the next four seasons there and he appointed Patrick Moratoglou as coach for 2012.</p>
