            <h2>2024: Masters quarterfinals career set and third final, 40th top 10 win, return to top 10</h2>
                     
            <p>Starting the season at Brisbane,he reached his third final there and 18th in his career overall 
                defeating Andy Murray, Daniel Altmaier, wildcard Rinky Hijikata and Jordan Thompson. He defeated top seed Holger Rune 
                in the final to win his ninth title and first since 2017. With the title win, 
                he recorded more match wins (23)  than any other player at this tournament. As a result, 
                he moved to No. 13 in the singles rankings on 8 January 2024, his highest since 2018.
                <br>

                Seeded 13th at the 2024 Australian Open where he made his record 52nd consecutive major 
                appearance, he reached the second round with a win over Marton Fucsovics, and then won over 
                Kokkinakis in the second round, but lost in the third round to Nuno Borges.
                <br><br>
                He reached his second final of the season in Marseille defeating Sebastian Korda, Arthur 
                Rinderknech and Karen Khachanov. In the final he lost to fourth seed Ugo Humbert. 
                He reached back to back semifinals at the Rotterdam Open, defeating Lorenzo Sonego, again Marton 
                Fucsovics and Alexander Shevchenko. He lost in the semifinals to Alex de Minaur, ending the 
                week with the most ATP singles wins, at 13, since the beginning of the season.
                <br><br>
                
                At Indian Wells, he reached the fourth round defeating two Frenchmen Alexandre Muller and
                 21st seed Adrian Mannarino. As a result, he returned to his highest ranking of world No. 12 
                 on 18 March 2024 for the first time since 29 October 2018 when he was ranked at No. 10. Seeded 11th at the 
                 2024 Miami Open, he reached the fourth round defeating Alejandro Tabilo in three sets[216] and Yannick Hanfmann
                  in a 46 minutes match, conceding one game. He won his next match against world No. 9 and eight seed Hubert Hurkacz
                   and thus completed the full career set of quarterfinal showings at all nine active Masters events becoming the ninth 
                   active man to accomplish this feat after Nadal, Djokovic, Murray, Monfils, Cilic, Thiem, Tsitsipas and Zverev. With 
                   making his 19th Masters quarterfinal in Miami, he reached that stage or higher of at least one Masters event every season
                    for 12 years in a row since 2013. With his 40th top 10 win over world No. 2 and top seed Carlos Alcaraz in the 
                    quarterfinals, he reached the semifinals of all Masters with the exception of the Madrid Open. He became just the third
                     man born in 1990 or later to record 40 or more Top 10 wins after Alexander Zverev and Daniil Medvedev and the eight active 
                     player overall. Dimitrov reached his third Masters final defeating back to back top 5 players (last time was
                      in Brisbane 2017), for his first win against fourth seed Alexander Zverev in 10 years, and 20th overall against the top 5.
                       He returned for the first time in 260 weeks (3rd longest gap in the Open Era) since November 2018 to the top 10 at world No. 
                       9 in the rankings. In the final, he lost in straight sets to world No. 3 and second seed Jannik Sinner.
                       <br><br>
                At the 2024 Monte-Carlo Masters he played the longest best-of-three match in the tournament history lasting 
                3 and half hours before succumbing to seventh seed Holger Rune in the round of 16. It was also the third-longest
                 match of any kind at this Masters 1000. At the 2024 Italian Open he reached again the round of 16, for the
                  first time since 2020 at this Masters, defeating two lefties Yoshihito Nishioka and qualifier Terence Atmane.</p>
